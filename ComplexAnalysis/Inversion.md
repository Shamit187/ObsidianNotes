$z = re^{i\theta}$
which means, 1/z is essentially, inverting radius and negative angle
$1/z = \frac{1}{r} e^{-i\theta}$
- Step 1: Geometric Inversion / Reflection
- Step 2: Reflection

### Visualizing Inversion

In Unit circle, C it acts as a reflection, 
- internal points (r < 1) will get flipped to external (r > 1)
- external points will get to internal
- if any point is on C, it will stay on that point
- Denoted as $\mathcal{J}_C \mapsto \frac{1}{\bar{z}}$ 

We can generalize this mapping to any circle K

for any radius R,
- length becomes $R^2/p$ if initial length is $p$
- any point on the circumference stays there
