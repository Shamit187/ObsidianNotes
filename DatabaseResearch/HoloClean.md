[[Holistic Data]] [[Data Cleaning]] Process
Inconsistent Data -> Holoclean -> Auto Data repairing with probabilistic Model
HoloClean scales to large (million tuple) data

Combine all data cleaning methods into a single package?

Input dataset <- noisy version of hidden clean dataset
Each signal <- evidence on the correctness

Generate a prob distribution
- random variables capture uncertainty over records in the dataset
- signal -> graphical model -> distribution characterization
