**Core:** Trying to find errors in data generation process ([[Systematic Error in Database]])

### Draft
Systematic error cause is domain specific
Somehow group errors that may stem from one type of generation error
Data X-ray does not report the actual error
Complexity -> Large Data, Cannot peak at the generation algorithm in a lot of cases, Generation errors happen in large quantity-maybe more than the correct data
